### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jogendra, Class of 2020 Graduate and Post Graduate in Physics from **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**. I am an iOS / Backend Engineer and an active Open Source contributor. My go-to programming languages for day to day tasks are **Golang** and **Swift**. I love tech and aviation equally, maybe aviation little bit more but not more than tech.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: CLI based projects
